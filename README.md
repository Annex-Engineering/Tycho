# Tycho

Tycho is a printer that is the definition of excess. What once started as a K2, has evolved into something utterly stupid. I have decided to move onto building something a bit more "robust", "different", and a bit smaller. Thus I am releasing the printer in its "finished" state, bugs and all. This will be the only release.

There is no sourcing guide or frame calculator, nor is there really help. Ive built one of these things, if you want to build one too, please visit our discord
